### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Fellow at MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. We are trying to figure out new ways to amplfy microwaves for fundamental physics. By using devices consisting of hundreds of Josephson junctions inside an ultra-cold dilution refrigirator, a signal interacts with a strong pump wave, exchanging energy and growing exponentially. We are hoping to use this technology to detect the faint radiowaves emitted by electrons captured in magnetic fields to ultimately measure the absolute neutrino mass. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything about superconducting wires, coax lines and antenna's.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about quantum amplifiers, particle physics and nuclear fusion. Or tavelling.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on startups that are welcoming technical expertise.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with projects turning fundamental science into applications.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: wvdp@mit.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always wanted to become an astronaut, and now ESA is actually recruiting them, fingers crossed!
