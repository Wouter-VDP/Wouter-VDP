### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Fellow at MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Together with Prof. Joe Formaggio, we are trying to figure out new ways to amplify microwaves for fundamental physics. By using devices consisting of hundreds of Josephson junctions inside an ultra-cold dilution refrigerator, a signal interacts with a strong pump wave, exchanging energy and growing exponentially. We hope to use this technology to detect the faint radio waves emitted by electrons captured in magnetic fields to measure the absolute neutrino mass ultimately.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything about superconducting wires, coax lines and antenna's.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about quantum amplifiers, particle physics and nuclear fusion. Or tavelling and nature.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on startups that are welcoming technical expertise.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with projects turning fundamental science into applications.
